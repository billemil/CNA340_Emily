# Number Guessing Game

This project employs the use of the random module and for loops with else if conditional statements.
This project will generate a random integer in the range 1 to 10, it will allow the user to guess
what that integer is 3 times.  The first two times the customer guesses, the program will return either: 
That is too high, That is too low, or That is correct.  If the user guesses wrong three times in a
row the program will give the correct answer and tell the user that they have lost.
